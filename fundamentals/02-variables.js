// In JavaScript there are 4 ways to declaring variables
// 1. const  (This variables cannot be changed in future)
// 2. let (value canbe change in future)
// 3. var (same age let , before ES6 var used for declaring variables)
// 4. you can decalre variables as like as x = 5; (not recommended)

const name = "Nayem";
let age = 10;
var x = 5;
y = 6;

console.log(`Hi! My name is ${name}. My age is ${age}. I am a student`);
console.log(`Sum of X and Y is ${x + y}`);
